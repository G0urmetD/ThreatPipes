# ThreatPipes
ThreatPipes is a reconnaissance tool that automatically queries 100â€™s of data sources to gather intelligence on IP addresses, domain names, e-mail addresses, names and more.
You simply specify the target you want to investigate, pick which modules to enable and then ThreatPipes will collect data to build up an understanding of all the entities and how they relate to each other.
DNS, Whois, Web pages, passive DNS, spam blacklists, file meta data, threat intelligence lists as well as services like SHODAN, HaveIBeenPwned? and more are used to find out more about a target and known affiliates.
The data returned from a ThreatPipes scan will reveal a lot of information about your target, providing insight into possible data leaks, vulnerabilities or other sensitive information that can be leveraged during a penetration test, red team exercise or for threat intelligence.
